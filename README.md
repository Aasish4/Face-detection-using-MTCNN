# Face detection using MTCNN
This is the implementation of Multi task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network for face detection by *Zhang, K et al. (2016)* [ZHANG2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02878)
The code has been forked from the official implementation of MTCNN by *ipazc* [MTCNN](https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn)
