# Face detection using MTCNN
This is the implementation of Multi task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network for face detection by *Zhang, K et al. (2016)* [ZHANG2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02878)
The code has been forked from the official implementation of MTCNN by *ipazc* [MTCNN](https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn)

## Installation
Use the requirements.txt file to install the dependencies.

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Use the jupyter notebook [face detection.ipynb](https://github.com/Aasish4/Face-detection-using-MTCNN/blob/main/Face%20detection.ipynb) for testing the implementation of MTCNN. All codes are beautifully quoted for knowledge at every steps.

## Output
This is the output of the model with bounding box detection and keypoints.\
